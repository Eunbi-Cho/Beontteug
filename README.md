## ðŸ‘€ Dyslexia
More than 700 million children and adults worldwide are suffering from dyslexia.
It is easier for dyslexic patients to read if the spacing between fonts, font color and spacing between lines, which are factors that affect human readability, are slightly modified.
But text in the physical world is hard to customize.

## ðŸ‘€ VisionKit
VisionKit technology can receive live text through the camera.
So this app used VisionKit to receive live text and customize it.

### 1) Capture texts through camera
  - You can see the texts of the physical world in your own style that you customed.

### 2) Customize texts that you can read more easily
  - There is no universal setting for better readability. So the app users can change the typography at the default setting quickly and often.
